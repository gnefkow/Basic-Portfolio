  <h2>about me.</h2>
  <p>I’m Kyle. I’m an American designer currently living around South East Asia,  but I'm heading back to America soon, actually.</p>

  <h2>What I  Do.</h2>
  <p>At the moment, I’m living in Yangon, Myanmar working on the digital transformation team for Yoma Bank. With the mission to “build a better Myanmar for its people,” we focus on bringing human centered design practices to understand and develop products that enable the unbanked sector to join and gain an understanding of the formal finance system.</p>
  <p>After getting my degree in industrial design, I worked for frog design on a number of experience strategy projects where I built skills in interaction design, design research, industrial design, and design thinking. After frog, I co-founded MedicSana after conducting a number of research interviews with Latino immigrants about how their families manage healthcare challenges across borders. Since then, I’ve worked on several freelance projects which gave me the opportunity to experiment moderating a Design Sprint in Mexico and build out the product strategy for an Austin-based social good start-up. I then spent some time with frog again in their Shanghai office where I helped an insurance company design a fitness tracking system, a car-share company re-think its future strategy, and even a skin-care company re-think its appea to Chinese men.</p>
  <p>I’m obsessed with the journey between research insight and product creation, so I’ve learned a lot about design research, agile software teams (I’m a certified Scrum Product Owner), and lean business model development.</p>
