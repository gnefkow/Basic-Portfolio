  <h2>about me.</h2>
  <p>I’m Kyle. I’m an American designer currently living around South East Asia,  but I'm heading back to America soon, actually.</p>

  <h2>What I  Do.</h2>
  <p>At the moment, I’m living in Yangon, Myanmar working on the digital transformation team for Yoma Bank. With the mission to “build a better Myanmar for its people,” we focus on bringing human centered design practices to understand and develop products that enable the unbanked sector to join and gain an understanding of the formal finance system.</p>
  <p>After getting my degree in industrial design, I worked for <a href="https://www.frogdesign.com/">frog design</a> on a number of experience strategy projects where I built skills in interaction design, design research, industrial design, and design thinking. After frog, I co-founded MedicSana after conducting a number of research interviews with Latino immigrants about how their families manage healthcare challenges across borders. Since then, I’ve worked on several freelance projects which gave me the opportunity to experiment moderating a Design Sprint in Mexico and build out the product strategy for an Austin-based social good start-up. I then spent some time with frog again in their Shanghai office where I helped an insurance company design a fitness tracking system, a car-share company re-think its future strategy, and even a skin-care company re-think its appea to Chinese men.</p>
  <p>I’m obsessed with the journey between research insight and product creation, so I’ve learned a lot about design research, agile software teams (I’m a certified Scrum Product Owner), and lean business model development.</p>

  <h2>why I do what I do.</h2>
  <p>When I was young, I used to explore in my grandfather’s basement, pouring over the hundreds of National Geographic magazines he’d collected over several decades. I dreamt of being a photographer, an explorer, or an archaeologist – discovering new worlds, trying to bend my brain to think in new ways. I spent my days drawing and working in the woodshop, taking things apart and struggling to put them back together.</p>
  <p>Today, my best days are when I’m in the field doing design research, brainstorming solutions to new problems, or simply wandering around – physically or metaphorically – a new environment. I love complex projects – the kinds that have a lot of variables and require a lot of learning. My favorite feeling is the flash of insight – that moment when you realize you were wrong about something – when someone or something gives you a brand new lens with which to see the world.</p>
 </div>

<div ID="aboutWhatIDo" class="bodyText">
  <h2>when I’m not designing things, I spend a lot of time reading and wandering.</h2>
  <p>I love learning about people’s perception of value – in the monetary, theological, or any other sense, so my favorite topics to read about include behavioral economics, development economics, cognitive psychology, history, and narratives about other cultures and what happens when they clash. I also love learning about systems, so books about economics, emergence, and systems thinking clutter my shelf. I’ve started collecting my thoughts and reflections on these topics on my blog, Knowledge in Society. </p>
  <p>I love to travel (21 countries and counting…), and spend hours wandering around a new place just listening and watching. My favorite things to discover are the physical manifestations of cognitive dissonance – clever hacks that people have done to circumvent the way systems around them were designed. These dissonant moments are often a key to discovering an interesting underlying system – something unexpected, and often unknown, that drives the artifacts and behavior that surround it. I’ve started collecting these moments on my blog under Snippets.</p>
  <p>Design research got be into photography as a way to tell stories. Over time, I’ve started thinking about it in the same way I think about drawing – as a new way to see. My photography portfolio is here.</p>
